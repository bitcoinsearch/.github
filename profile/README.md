## Bitcoin Search

At Bitcoin Search we are building a data infrastructure that aims to curate, process, and provide access to the depths of bitcoin's technical ecosystem.

GitHub Actions manage the scheduling of cron jobs across the data infrastructure. The process begins with data collection ([scraper](https://github.com/bitcoinsearch/scraper)), followed by data processing ([summarizer](https://github.com/bitcoinsearch/summarizer)). All workflows are documented in their respective project README files. 

You can find more details in [bitcoinsearch/infrastructure](https://github.com/bitcoinsearch/infrastructure).
